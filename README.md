## ⌨️ Hotkeys

| Hotkey                                 | Action                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Alt + 1–9**                          | Switch to Desktop 1–9               |
| **Alt + Q**                            | Close current desktop               |

You can customize these bindings easily inside SwitchDesktops.ahk.
And I suggest you look at the documentationt of the `dll` to see the function that provides.

## 🔄 Auto-Launch on Startup

To make the script run automatically when you log in:

Press `Win + R` → type `shell:startup` → press Enter

Copy a shortcut to SwitchDesktops.ahk into that folder.

Next time you boot your PC, your hotkeys will be ready automatically.

## 🧩 File Structure

Again, make sure that the folder that the script is in looks like this

```bash
.
├── SwitchDesktops.ahk          # Main AutoHotkey script
└── VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll  # Native DLL for Windows virtual desktop API
```
